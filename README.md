A little about how I put all this together...

1. First I created a repo on git hub and cloned it on my local machine. 
2. I created 3 html files (index, portfolio, contact)
3. Made a quick wire frame sketch of what I wanted the pages to look like
4. Added the necessary head elements inc... link to style sheet, link to bootstrap for CSS, google font link.
5. Chose navbar option from bootstrap and changed the link headings to match my pages.
6. linked the nav headings the the appropriate pages.
7. Went to index.html page and created a template of the bootstrap structure based on my wireframe sketch (container, rows, columns, and added some divs too)
8. copied and pasted this template onto the other pages so the pages follow the same structure
9. Made the fist row describing the pages function and copied and pasted to the other pages - changing text to fit page purpose
10. found cards on bootstrap and copied and pasted them into index and portfolio page
11. edited these cards and added images to match
12. added contact form to contact page from bootstrap framework
13. Spend time playind around with the CSS stylesheet to get a design I liked
14. checked all the links were working
15. troubleshooting things I couldn't get to work
        - collapsable nav option for smaller screen
        - couldn't figure out how to do anything with the sticky footer
        - totally forgot about adding media queries (not sure if I needed them)
16. Right now I am writing this Readme document
17. After this I plan on Pushing to git hub and submitting the homework
